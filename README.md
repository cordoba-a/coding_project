# c++_notes

## Description  
This repository contains a collection of C++ programs and projects developed for academic purposes and personal exploration.  
The content focuses on fundamental and advanced C++ concepts, including object-oriented programming, algorithms, data structures, and memory management. The repository serves as a centralized resource for organizing C++ code and encouraging good programming practices.

## Motivation  
This repository was created with the following goals:  
1. To document and organize C++ programs for academic and personal use.  
2. To explore and implement key C++ concepts, such as object-oriented design, efficient algorithms, and system-level programming.  
3. To leverage Xcode as a powerful IDE for writing, debugging, and testing C++ code on macOS.  
4. To maintain a version-controlled resource for reusable code and templates for future projects.  
5. To support the learning process by experimenting with C++ libraries and features.  

## System requirements  
**Hardware:**  
- A macOS computer with at least 4 GB of RAM and 2 GB of free disk space.  

**Software:**  
- macOS Catalina (10.15) or later.  
- Xcode (latest version recommended), available on the Mac App Store.  
- C++17 or later standard (included with Xcode's Clang compiler).  

## Install  
1. **Install Xcode:**  
   - Download and install Xcode from the Mac App Store.  
   - Ensure that Xcode Command Line Tools are installed by running the following command in Terminal:  
     ```bash
     xcode-select --install
     ```  

2. **Set up the repository:**  
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:  
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```  

3. **Open projects in Xcode:**  
   - Open Xcode and navigate to `File > Open` to load any project from this repository.  
   - Alternatively, use the Terminal to open a project file:  
     ```bash
     open <project_file>.xcodeproj
     ```  

4. **Build and run:**  
   - Use the Build (`⌘B`) and Run (`⌘R`) buttons in Xcode to compile and execute the programs.

5. **Optional libraries:**  
   - If a program depends on external libraries, follow the instructions provided in the repository's documentation for installation.
